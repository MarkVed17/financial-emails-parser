fee of Rs. 500, the card offers two free movie tickets each month. This makes this card a suitable choice for beginners who are comfortable maximizing the benefits on their card for entertainment. Spending a minimum of Rs. 60,000 every year (5,000 per month) can fetch users a benefit of Rs. 6,000 on BookMyShow. Additionally, extending the annual spending up to Rs. 1.5 Lakh can also help in saving an additional Rs. 5,000 via the annual fee waiver. The card can also be a good addition to the existing credit card users wallets for bridging the absence of movie benefits on their existing cards.\\u00a0\"},{\"id\":\"9150caee-e957-43bd-868e-cbff2ff2e7ec\",\"title\":\"Axis My Zone Credit Card\",\"card_id\":\"9150caee-e957-43bd-868e-cbff2ff2e7ec\",\"card_name\":\"Axis My Zone Credit Card\",\"keywords\":\"axis credit card,axis card,axis bank credit card,axis bank card,myzone,axis myzone,my zone,axis my zone,axis myzone credit card,axis my zone credit card\",\"slug\":\"axis-bank-my-zone-credit-cards\",\"bank_id\":\"27\",\"active\":\"1\",\"created_at\":\"2023-12-21 11:55:59\",\"updated_at\":\"2025-08-13 11:45:48\",\"categories\":[],\"faq\":[{\"answers\":\"No, you cannot earn reward points for movie, fuel and EMI transactions.
